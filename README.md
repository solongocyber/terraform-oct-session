## Description
What is Terraform?

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as a code software tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud and on-prem resources safely and efficiently. Created by HashiCorp and it allows infrastructure to be express as code in a simple, human readdable language called HCL. It reads configuration files and provides an execution plan of changes, which can be reviewed for safety and then applied and provisioned. User define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.  Terraform manages external resources with "provider". Users can interact with Terraform providers by declaring resources or by calling data source. Terraform uses declarative configuration to describe the desired final state. 

## Installing Terraform

[Here is the Terraform official site link.] https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli

We uses Amazon Linux run listed below commands:

``sudo yum install -y yum-utils``

``sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
``

`` sudo yum -y install terraform ``


### Terraform Provider

Terraform relies on plugins called "providers" to interact with remote system. We have to provide which provider to use, if more than 1 provider needs to declare both providers in the configuration file. Terraform can install and use them. Each provider adds a set of resource typr and data sources that terraform cam mange. 

## Terraform Syntax

Arguments and Blocks

Arguments:

An argument assigns a value to a particular name:

The identifier before the equals sign is the argument name,for example: `ami` `instance_type` and the expression after the equals sign is the argument's value `t2.micro`. 

Blocks:

A block is a container for other content. There are 2 types of block;
1. Resource block
2. Data block

A block has a type (resource in this example). Each block type defines how many labels must folow the type keyword. the ``resource block`` type expects 2 labels, which are `aws_instance` and `first_ec2` in this exmaple.

`resource` = block
`ami` = argument or component of resource
`t2.micro` = value defined by me

## Basic commands in Terraform

``terraform init
``

`` terraform plan``

``terraform apply``

`` terraform destroy``


``terraform init``:
 
 This command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. After run this command Terraform does in the background:

- Copy a Source Module
- Backend Initialization
- child Module Installation
- Plugin Installation

``terraform plan``: 

This command is used to create an execution plan. Run it and check it out what changes will happen in resources or the state. 

``terraform apply``:

This command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configureation, ot the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan.

``terraform destroy``:

Infrastructure managed by Terraform will be destroyed. 

There are several different way to set terraform Version. It's best practice to defined in the configuration file. 

to authenticate with AWS, so that terraform can manage resources there, it looks up credentials in the following order:

1. Static credentials: Define access key and secret key in the configuration file. 

 2. Environment variables:
 3. Shared credentails file:
 $HOME/.aws/credentials-default location
 4. EC2 IAM Role.

### Version 

- Terraform v1.3.2

It is also possible to set the required terraform version in various ways:

`required_version = ">= 0.13, < 0.14"` 

should be less then 0.14 and higher or equal to 0.13

`required_version = "= 0.14"`

should be equal to 0.14

For all possible options refer to the following page: https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/version-constraints.html#version-constraint-syntax
